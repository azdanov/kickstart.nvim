## Introduction

This is my personal Neovim configuration, adapted from the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/) project.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Neovim (latest stable or nightly version)
- Git

- A Nerd Font

### Language-Specific Requirements

Depending on the languages you work with, you may need additional tools:

- Golang: go
- [Add any other language-specific tools you use]

### Setup
